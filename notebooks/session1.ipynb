    "- **Created by**: Guido van Rossum\n",
    "- **First Released**: 1991\n",
    "- **Name Inspiration**: Named after the British comedy group Monty Python\n",
    "- **Philosophy**: Emphasizes code readability and simplicity (see the Zen of Python: `import this`)\n",
    "- **Python 2 vs Python 3**: Python 2 was discontinued in 2020; Python 3 is the current and future of the language."

    "- **Readability**: Python uses indentation instead of braces `{}` for code blocks, making it more readable.\n",
    "- **Interpreted**: Python is an interpreted language, meaning it executes code line-by-line without the need for compilation.\n",
    "- **Dynamic Typing**: Variables do not need explicit type declaration (e.g., `x = 10` instead of `int x = 10`).\n",
    "- **Batteries Included**: Python comes with a large standard library for tasks like file I/O, regular expressions, and more.\n",
    "- **Cross-Platform**: Python code can run on Windows, macOS, and Linux without modification."

    "  - **Minor version (9)**: New features, backward-compatible.\n",

    "- **Python 2 vs Python 3**: Python 3 introduced breaking changes (e.g., `print` is now a function, not a statement).\n",
